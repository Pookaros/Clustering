# Clustering
2-d Hierarcical/k-means++ Clustering with automated cluster selection.
Planning to make it 3-d in the future let's see how it goes.
Could also make it n-dimentional but n>3 will have no cluster graph only dendrogramm/elbow :(.
Most of the effort here as funny as it seems to be, was automating the no of cluster selections using dendrogramm/elbow diagrams.
Import your own datasets line:#9 and use only dimensions of them selectively line:#10.
UPDATE 28/10: Made it 3-d Hierarcical/k-means++ at last, there are more to implement though and a lot of code optimization to do, there were some problems with the dendrogram but I will manage. Also I am starting an image clustering programm based on the preevious 2. I am almost there, it's a contraption under construction :P. I also wanna note that there is a lot of spread code in comments cause I am saving it for potential use.
UPDATE 7/11: Well the image clustering is ready work with png jpg rgb files. I will try to reduce the noise of the images even more in the near future but for the time beign I would like to make it create convex hulls for the clusters. After that I think I can train it circling discrete objects in the picture.
Update 5/12: I made code more ergonomical and more readable, I made the recorder of the basketapp fully functional. I was in one year's break and my python skills are much better now. The problem is that just looking at my old code hurts my guts. Litle by litle it's gonna be fixed. 
I have a UI for the basketball app as well I will upload when it's ready. I am planning in making a video processing app for the basketapp, It's gonna be hard but its is doable.
